StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is the long-awaited sequel to the original StarCraft, Blizzard Entertainment’s critically acclaimed sci-fi real-time strategy game. StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty is both a challenging single-player game and a fast-paced multiplayer game, and it also taps into Battle.net – Blizzard Entertainment’s fully-featured online gaming service. So, what exactly is StarCraft II? Read on and find out.

In typical real-time strategy games, players build armies and vie for control of the battlefield. The armies in play can be as small as a single squad of Marines or as large as a full-blown planetary invasion force. As commander, you observe the battlefield from a top-down perspective and issue orders to your units in real time. Strategic thinking is key to success; you need to gather information about your opponents, anticipate their moves, outflank their attacks, and formulate a winning strategy.

StarCraft II features three distinct ’races’ whose armies comprise entirely unique units and structures. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, and knowing their tactical profiles can mean the difference between glorious victory or crushing defeat.
