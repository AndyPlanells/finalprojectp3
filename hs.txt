Hearthstone is a digital collectible card game that revolves around turn-based matches between two opponents, operated through Blizzard's Battle.net. Players can choose from a number of game modes, with each offering a slightly different experience. Players start the game with a substantial collection of basic cards, but can gain rarer and more powerful cards through purchasing packs of cards or as reward for completing Arena runs. In-game gold is rewarded for completing randomized daily quests, where one is given each day stacking up to three with one quest able to be rerolled per day, and by winning matches in ranked play, where 10 gold per three wins is earned with a 100 gold limit per day.

Hearthstone is supported by micropayments for booster packs, Arena Mode entries and Adventure Mode access. Furthermore, unlike other card games, Hearthstone does not use a trading card system and instead allows players to 'disenchant' unwanted cards into an 'arcane dust' resource, which can then be used to 'craft' cards of the player's choice. Hamilton Chu, executive producer of Hearthstone stated while talking about why blizzard doesn't plan on adding a trading card system that, "...a key thing for us was focusing on [the user]... playing the game". Blizzard wanted to do things such as avoid a free market where card values could fluctuate, discourage cheating methods like bots and duping, cut unathorizared third party sellers against the terms of terms of service out of the equation, and keep all the profit derived from the game for the company.

Hearthstone is set within the Warcraft universe, with its characters, spells and locations drawing from existing lore.
